  <h2>Our Awesome Staff</br></h2>
  <ul id="staff_info">
  <li><img src="images/staff/tonyjcollins.jpg" id="img1" alt="Tony J Collins"><p>Tony Collins<br> <b>Co-Owner / Engineer</b></p><p> Starting my first band in the late 90's, the love of music was always a big part of my life. Having my first studio in the early 2000's, I started to learn the ways things sound and are supposed to sound and match. SoundSpot Studios is a dream that has come true, my home away from home. To be able to work and do something you love is the greatest thing you can do. </p></li>
  <li><img src="images/staff/juanchirinos.jpg" id="img2" alt="Juan"><p>Juan<br> <b>Co-Owner</b></p><p>I started my love of music when I was 10 years old, which began with hearing my dad play and all started with music from the Beatles and Cream. From that, I went on to play the drums and finding that wasn't for me, I changed to guitar. With influences like K.I.S.S, Venom, and Slayer, I knew I wanted to play guitar for a living. Music is now my life and my inspiration.</p></li>
  <li><img src="images/staff/garrin.jpg" id="img3" alt="Garrin"><p>Garrin Parker<br> <b>Lead Engineer</b></p><p>With an interest that was nurtured with music of the 50's and 60's, Garrin started playing guitar at the age of 5 and was playing saxophone by the age of 10. In his early teen years his love of music turned to all things metal. Garrin's musical interests have always trended to "the other side of the glass" and wanting to craft his own sounds and stying of producing.</p></li>
